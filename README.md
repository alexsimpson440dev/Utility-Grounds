# Utility-Grounds
Utility-Grounds Is a python/flask application that allows users to sign in, view monthly utilities, and send payment. This is all managed through a utility Manager that can access those utilities, update them, delete, and set deadlines.

As long as all of the requirments are there, you shouldnt need to do anything to make this application work. Just run it, and add data to the database.

In order to get a manager login, you need to manually change the user_level to 1
